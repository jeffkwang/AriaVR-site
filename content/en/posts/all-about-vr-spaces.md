You have heard about work spaces, meditation spaces, yoga spaces, reading spaces — the list goes on and on. If you are reading this, you may be considering another space: the VR space. Software aside, it is the VR space that makes or break a VR experience. Imagine being able to freely move within a room without the danger of crashing into walls or other objects. How would you create such a place?

To the best of my knowledge, there is not one place you can glean information on VR spaces. Headset makers have not specified much apart from having a minimum space to use VR. Of course, having a dedicated room for VR is best, but from what we’ve seen, they aren’t much of a living space, per se. To help you in creating a VR space that optimizes for form and function, we have collected various spaces — both for commercial and home — and displayed them below. You’ll find rooms with minimalist, elegant, and modern styles, and we hope you find inspiration for your personal VR space. 

Make sure to post pictures of your space and tag us @ariavrofficial on Instagram. We’d love to feature your space in upcoming posts.

# 5 Essential VR Spaces

### Sandbox VR

Minimalism at its peak. When you enter any Sandbox VR location, there’s not much to notice. They have stripped away most of everything physical and invested all of it into the virtual. They want you to know that. Plain & simple with an modern touch, you can’t go wrong with this setup.

### Tea/Meditation/Reading/VR Room

Comfort meets utility meets elegance. If this were the Swiss army knife of rooms, it would be among the most elegant of the bunch. The room is perfectly balanced, with not too many furnishings and just the right amount of space for most VR activities. It’s a room you’d want to be in — whether in VR or not.

### Living Room VR With A View

Views upon views. This Redditor has made a VR space in their living room. While it may not be the most effective VR space, we applaud them for their chic styling and the courage to use VR next to those windows.

### Living Room VR II

Here’s another living room with a VR space. There’s also a work / gaming desk. We like the space’s modern aesthetic with the personal touch. Furthermore, the Redditor has safety in mind with the positioning of the sofa in front of the TV screen and the office chair in front of the desk. Overall, the setup does a great job of balancing safety, style, and function.

### The Minimal Workspace

The allure of minimalism is augmented by VR in the announcement and showcase of the Apple Vision Pro. Amidst a primarily blank wall, the display makes it feel like you actually have the power of computing at your fingertips. Modern, minimalistic, and highly functional — this is the pinnacle of form and function.
