# Designing Around Space

In interior design, a core goal is to maximize the potential of every space. Yet, there are contrasting schools of thought that challenge conventional design norms. As such, they offer fresh perspectives on the art of creating living spaces that value empty space. Among these contrasting philosophies, Zen minimalism and Hygge stand out as compelling choices. The result is nothing short of remarkable. These are living spaces that are not just aesthetically pleasing but also offer plenty of room to move about.

Minimalism, the art of "a place for everything and everything in its place," is a philosophy that may seem perplexing. But, it leads to spaces that are both visually stunning and highly functional. It places great importance on the meticulous placement, form, and function of every piece of furniture and decor within a room. Natural color hues characterize the minimalist palette, including soothing sky blues, light browns, brownish-reds, and pristine whites. The design also places a significant emphasis on harnessing natural light. Natural light serves the vital purpose of harmonizing all the room's colors into a cohesive whole.

Zen minimalism, with its origins in Japan, takes the concept of minimalism to new heights. Characterized by low-to-the-ground style, it encourages movement within the living space. Besides physical flow, this design philosophy also creates a serene atmosphere.

In the Western world, the most renowned manifestation of minimalism is Hygge, hailing from Scandinavia. At its core, it is all about discovering comfort and contentment in life's simple pleasures. As such, it is a heartwarming and inviting approach to interior design.

To offer you a wealth of inspiration, we have handpicked a collection of seven rooms that exemplify these design styles. Each room serves as a testament to how they can transform any living space into an oasis of beauty and functionality.

# Seven Open Space Living Room Designs

![Two bean bags and a rug living area](/images/gen/blog/content2-1.webp)

### 1. Casual Minimal Living Room

This casual living room may not be the style of choice for a family, but it’s a no-frills, frugal design for an apartment living room. Off the bat, we see the resemblance of minimalism. Besides the sparse furnishing, every single object contributes, in one way or another, to maximizing free movement. All the while, we see a richly decorated room. 

One way that the room is well designed is through the rife wall decor from the dais upwards. The paintings — the ones leaning against or on the wall — create an ethereal illusion. It makes it seem they are lightweight and suspended in mid-air. Not only does this enhance the depth of space, but it also does not detract from the minimalist theme. If you’re going for a casual look like that of this design, the bean bag chairs and tray are a fitting addition. They are rather lightweight and portable, allowing you to adapt to whatever your space needs are. Although they are not typical in living rooms, we still get the impression of one.

The color scheme of the room is a rather harmonious one and also is common in many Zen designs. The light navy blue and charcoal gray denim of the bean bags are the more colorful items jutting out against the white background. Also, the contrast of the black painting, side table, tray, and stool to the lighter colors create a sleek, modern effect. The sunlight blends the colors to get the beautifully crafted interior.

### 2. A Modern Zen Room

Here is a modern Zen living room, better designed for a household. This room exudes a quiet confidence, for it speaks volumes without having much in it. Immediately, straight edges are noticeable all over the room. The edges of the rug, coffee table, dais, and raised floor are all straight, not mentioning other decor. Straight edges are another means of creating a minimalist room — a modern one, at that. All the while, the roundness of the vases and pots contrast these to balance the room. Essentially, what we are seeing here is a rendition of ordered chaos. Straight represents form and order while roundness would represent chaos and formlessness. The interplay between these two elements create visual intrigue and great harmony. 

The larger furnishings and abstract decor blend traditional and minimalist design. The coffee table has a looming presence, but its low style — typical in this sort of design `— contrasts that. Further, an assortment of round-shaped pieces adorn the raised floor and dais. As opposed to the immaculate style of Zen minimalism, they disperse throughout the space. Both this dispersion and their abstractness create a more modern feel in the room. 

The color scheme embodies minimalist tenets by celebrating the allure of natural wood in all its varying shades. At its core, a diverse spectrum of wooden tones takes center stage. The dark mahogany of the dais commands attention but is set against a lighter-colored table, serving as the room's centerpiece. Finally, the palette is woven into the interior against a backdrop of lighter colors.

### 3. Another Modern Zen Room

This living room design beautifully combines minimalist elements of aesthetic and space-consciousness. It's a perfect choice for smaller spaces, like the first design, while maintaining an air of refinement. In this space, we'll delve into the elements that make it so appealing.

Space-consciousness is at the heart of this design. Every object has a clear role in the space, leaving no ambiguity of the matter. The low style coffee table and seating is characteristic of minimalist design. For the matter, they are portable and flexible. About multifunctionality, they are highly valued.

In the pursuit of elegant form, simplicity is the guiding principle. The use of natural materials, a hallmark of minimalist design, emphasizes this commitment to simplicity. Each piece stands as a testament to the beauty found in the material itself, devoid of unnecessary embellishments. It's a celebration of the raw, organic textures and hues that bring warmth and authenticity to the space.

The color palette of this design adheres to the principles of traditional minimalism, focusing on earthy browns. There is the dark brown of the stool. There is the light browns of the coffee table and seating dais. And, there is the various brown-colored pillows on top. The various shades complement the natural theme of the space.

### 4. An Open Space Design

In our next design, we're departing from minimalism and embracing an American flair. Still, this living room embodies an open and inviting space with Eurocentric pieces that create a cozy atmosphere. Within this 2-in-1 design, the concept of physical boundaries takes center stage. The open layout uses the sectional to divide the kitchen and living area, giving each space its distinct character. 

The choice of the sectional is well-considered, explicitly defining the living area and creating a sense of openness. Its strategic placement maximizes its impact, making the entire space feel welcoming and spacious. The matching ottoman serves as a delightful centerpiece; its rounded shape provides a suitable contrast to the room's straighter edges. It also embodies flexibility and portability, in harmony with minimalist design principles. To tie it all together, a stylish rug elegantly encompasses the living area, grounding the design.

The contrast between the color palette in the living area and the kitchen area plays a significant role in grounding the design. In the living space, modern color tones take center stage, featuring a palette that includes cream white, cobalt blue, and light green. These vibrant and light hues blend with the abundant natural light, evoking a serene ambiance akin to a tranquil Sunday afternoon. The living area's color comes to life under the sunlight, standing in stark contrast to the darker hues more common in the kitchen space. The natural tones of the tray impart a much-needed touch of traditional minimalism. 

In its entirety, the colors converge on the backdrop of the hardwood floor, adding depth and warmth to the aesthetic.

### 5. The Pacific Bench 3-Piece U-Shaped Sectional by Crate and Barrel

THIS IS NOT AN AD. 

Let us delve a bit deeper into designs using sectionals. We first turn our attention towards the versatility of sectionals in space-conscious design. Sectionals are quite multi-functional; it can serve as a practical physical boundary while adding immense comfort to the space. As a physical boundary, they fulfill their role with ease. Yet, where space is scarce, you may opt for a modular or partial sectional to fit your constraints. With modular sectionals, you gain the benefit of defining your boundaries as you need.

Traditional minimalist design often incorporates smaller-sized furnishings dispersed throughout the room. This scattering of objects creates an open, spacious atmosphere that enhances the sense of flow. But, the dense and composite structure of a sectional is quite different from this approach. The good news is that there are alternative methods to infuse a sense of flow into your space. One effective approach involves the strategic use of round shapes. In this particular design, for example, the round coffee table balances the rectangular sectional.

Lastly, the choice of color is a crucial consideration when incorporating such a large piece into your design. In most cases, sectionals work best in neutral tones, which typically include lighter and whiter hues. Much like rugs, such a sectional provides a backdrop against which smaller, more colorful accents in the room can shine.

### 6. Flex Space Design

This design epitomizes a modular sectional arrangement. As such, it caters to those prioritizing space efficiency in their homes. Comprising two ottoman poufs and a sofa, each element emphasizes compactness and mobility. The result is a stylish space that adapts to various circumstances. Moving on, we touch upon some core aspects that define the living area.

Simplicity is the driving force behind this design philosophy. From the sofa to the ottomans to the side table, it is evident in every piece. The sofa stands out with its sleek and compact form, omitting traditional backrests and sides for a minimalist profile. This choice enhances the sense of fluidity and openness within the room. The ottomans, equally unassuming and functional, add to the charm of simplicity. They serve as versatile components, transforming into footrests or more surface space as the need arises.

This design features a contemporary color palette that adds great elegance. The ottomans take center stage with their pristine white upholstery, adorned with linen and resting on a wooden base. The sofa complements the ensemble with its light gray hue and matching linen lining. Cushions in muted brown and gray colors lie on top. Across the room, a partly concealed black side table completes the modern color scheme. It all comes together in a comprehensive palette that creates a sleek and sophisticated atmosphere for the room.

In summary, this design's essence lies in its efficient use of space, simplicity, and a contemporary color palette. These elements combine to create a stylish and adaptable living area, making it a welcoming space for all.

### 7. Scandinavian Zen (Japandi) Living Room

Japandi is a harmonious fusion of two distinct yet complementary design philosophies: Zen and Hygge. In this style, timeless design principles merge with contemporary aesthetics. Drawing from Zen, this style embodies simplicity, clean lines, and an uncluttered ambiance that promotes tranquility. Simultaneously, it incorporates the essence of Hygge, embracing comfort, soft textures, and a sense of coziness that welcomes you with open arms. It is a design philosophy that encapsulates the best of both worlds, offering a balanced and harmonious living space where modern elegance meets timeless serenity. 

While appearing cluttered, the setup is versatile. Every piece serves a purpose, yet it allows for subtraction. As such, you can create an open and tranquil space without compromising the Japandi theme. The furniture elements within the room exemplify the essence of Japandi style. Low-profile seating, including a futon and pillow set, along with a coffee table and stool, embraces the Japanese influence. These pieces, along with the two rugs that cover the legs of the sofa chairs, adhere to the principle of simplicity. Textural contrast prevails with the use of flat-weave linen and cotton against plush wool. The overarching theme of this space is one of tranquility, and every element plays its part in achieving a sense of serene sophistication.

The living room embraces a modern and minimalist color palette. A bold reddish-brown hue adds a contemporary touch that stands out, while the presence of calm white and lighter wood tones adheres to a more traditional minimalist design. This harmonious contrast between bold and neutral tones creates a balanced and inviting atmosphere.

Japandi design represents a contemporary take on minimalism. Aesthetics meet flexibility and simplicity in an elegant fusion. This style encapsulates the best of both worlds, resulting in a visually appealing and versatile design ethos.
