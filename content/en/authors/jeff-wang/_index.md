Freshly out of college, Jeff founded AriaVR as a result of his fascination with the technology. He truly believes VR has the potential for great good, helping us achieve better versions of ourselves. Howver, the consumer-level technology is still rather primitive, and there is a lot of infrastructure, tangible and intangible, that needs to be created. Known to be a self-starter and highly independent, Jeff is pursuing his vision for advanced VR technology through AriaVR.
