# What is AriaVR?
\
<b>AriaVR is a product of my obsession with VR.</b> When I first tried the Meta Quest 2 at home, I was hooked. 

To my surprise, my friends did not share the same enthusiasm. They said VR was too fake, too virtual. 

And so, I thought, "Why isn't there a venue for VR enthusiasts?" VR can and very much be a powerful shared experience. Like its cousin, AR, VR is a powerful supplement to our reality.

This leads to my first idea: a wellness studio using VR. I believe that VR has powerful healing applications. Namely, the experiences in VR are real enough to reshape our self-narratives. In addition, immersive fitness and meditation are gamechanging, in my humble opinion. This is quite a large project to tackle, and it's definitely still in my future plans.

The biggest problem that that idea poses is space. How would a VR wellness studio look like? From my use of VR, the definition of a proper VR space is quite ambiguous, except that it should be within a box of minimum 6.5 feet on all sides. And, that brings us to what I am doing today.

The problem that we want to solve is curating the best experience for VR users at home. There are a variety of DIY VR room setups. However, each is unique to the user. I am here to do the hard work for you to provide everything you need to build the best VR space for you.

AriaVR is the hub for all your VR space needs.
