# What is AriaVR?

AriaVR is the culmination of our deep appreciation for virtual reality (VR). What began as a tool for astronaut training has now reached homes, offering unmatched experiences in gaming, health, and mindfulness. Our passion for VR stems from its transformative potential and our personal engagements with it.

However, a seamless VR experience requires an accommodating physical space. This balance between the virtual realm and our tangible surroundings can sometimes be challenging. Users might find themselves stepping out of the designated play area, emphasizing the importance of spatial awareness.

To bridge this gap, AriaVR presents specially crafted furniture and home decor that cater to VR enthusiasts. These products, while practical and aesthetic, are designed to elevate the VR experience in daily life settings.

One such innovation is highlighted at the start of this pageâ€”a rug with embedded sensors. This rug communicates with VR headsets to provide spatial information, enhancing the immersion factor. As we look ahead, we envision a suite of furniture that integrates with VR, ensuring users enjoy an enriched and uninterrupted journey between realities.
