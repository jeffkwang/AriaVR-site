# What is AriaVR?
\
<b>AriaVR is a product of my obsession with VR.</b> 

When I first tried the Meta Quest 2 at home, I was hooked. 

When I tried the Meta Quest 2 at home for the first time, I was immediately hooked. But to my surprise, my friends didn't share the same enthusiasm - they thought VR was too fake and too virtual.

That got me thinking: why isn't there a venue for VR enthusiasts? I firmly believe that VR has the potential to offer powerful shared experiences, just like its cousin, augmented reality (AR).

My first idea was to create a wellness studio that used VR for healing and transformative experiences. I believed that the immersive nature of VR could reshape self-narratives and offer exciting opportunities for fitness and meditation. However, I've got to admit that this is a project too large to tackle. Luckily, the idea presented multitude of problems to solve.

One of the biggest problems is space and form. That is, how would a VR wellness studio look like? That got me thinking about how people use VR at home. From my own experience, I had to physically create a safe and open VR space in my garage. In doing so, I realized there were no readily available kits or consensus on the matter.  

That's where AriaVR comes in. We are all about curating the perfect VR space in your own home. Whether it's finding the right equipment or designing the ideal layout, I'm dedicated to making it as easy as possible for VR enthusiasts to create their own perfect VR space.

# About Jeff
\
Born and raised in sunny Fremont, CA, Jeff grew up in the wholesale business. He used to roam his father's 
warehouse, but his father's employees would take him back into the office. When he was old enough, he started
helping around. First, he helped copy and print product instruction manuals. Then, he helped assemble product
displays. Finally, he helped package products for shipment. Indeed, he was an apprentice to his father. And, the
most important lessons he learned were on integrity and craftsmanship.\
\
Jeff holds these values near and dear, and he makes sure they form the core of every decision he makes. He has
recently graduated from the University of Southern California, with degrees in economics and mathematics. He now
faces the trials of entrepreneurship as his father and grandfather had done before him.\

In his free time, Jeff enjoys running or cycling. He also has a passion for creative writing.
